## I. Introduction

You can connect nodes in your workspace to create a workflow that processes data and generates output. Here are some common connections you can make:

### LLM to Application

For some application nodes, you can connect an LLM node to it. This connection allows you to process text data using language models and generate output in the application.

### Prompt, Database, Schema, or Tool to Thread

To make the thread node functional, you need to connect a prompt, database, schema, or tool node to it. This connection allows you to provide input data to the thread node for processing.

[![Prompt, Database, Schema, or Tool to Thread](./docs/prompt-to-thread.gif)](./docs/prompt-to-thread.gif)

Examples:
- Connect a prompt node to the thread node to provide input text for processing.
- Connect a database node to the thread node to fetch data for processing.
- Connect a schema node to the thread node to define the structure of the data.

## II. Delete Connection

To delete a connection between two nodes, click on the connection line and press the delete key. This action removes the connection and disconnects the nodes.
