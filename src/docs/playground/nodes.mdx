## I. Introduction

By default, the following nodes are always present in your workspace to help you get started:

### Session Info Node
- **Purpose**: Displays current session information, such as session count and details.
- **Usage**: Provides essential session-related data to enhance user experience.

### Toolbar Node
- **Purpose**: Provides quick access to tools and options.
- **Usage**: Use this node to enhance productivity by accessing frequently used functions.

### Application Bar Node
- **Purpose**: Creates a navigation or application bar.
- **Usage**: Enhances the user interface with organized navigation elements.

These nodes are foundational and provide essential functionality to help you begin your workflow efficiently.

## II. How to Add New Nodes

To create new nodes related to your workflow, you can use the Toolbar. Here's how you can add nodes like LLM, Thread, Vector Database, and more:

## III. Interaction with Nodes

Once you have added nodes to your workspace, you can interact with them to perform various actions. Here are some common interactions you can have with nodes:
* Drag and drop nodes to rearrange them in your workspace.
* Connect nodes to create a workflow by dragging a line from one node's output to another node's input.

## IV. Delete node

Delete nodes by selecting them and pressing the delete key or using the delete option from node header.
