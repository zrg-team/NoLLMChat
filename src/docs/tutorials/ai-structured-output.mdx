## Structured Output with WebLLM

Please follows the "Get Started Flow" first.

- [Get Started Flow](./#/document/get-started)

Now you can use the structured output feature to generate structured data from text data. Here is how you can do it:

### 1. Create a Chema Node

You can define fields and data types in the schema node. The schema node is used to define the structure of the data that you want to generate.

### 2. Connect Schema to a Thread Node

To generate structured data, you need to connect the schema node to a thread node. The thread node processes the input data and generates structured data based on the schema.
